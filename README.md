# PiNN
This project was prepared as the final project for the course Special Topics in AI III (Neural Differential Equations). The content provided by the given GitHub code includes the following:

The process of modeling the Laplace equation and the Fisher-KPP equation using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) can be examined.
The Allen-Cahn simulation is modeled using PINNs, and the coefficients of each term in the differential equation can also be inferred.
For case 2, the simulation results are not perfectly accurate due to the insufficient number of layers, but they generally show consistent trends. The Allen-Cahn simulation can be reviewed in the file Allen-Cahn Simulation.ipynb.
